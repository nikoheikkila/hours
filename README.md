# ‚è∞ Hours

Working as a consultant requires you to mark your billed project hours periodically for invoicing. This is boring but luckily [**Toggl**][toggl] is there to help. Unfortunately, not everyone is using it directly.

**Hours** is a command-line tool built with **Go** for integrating to Toggl Track. Currently, it supports the following features:

- listing saved time entries in various formats

Upcoming and planned features are:

- creating new time entries
- deleting saved time entries
- starting and stopping the timer on certain tasks

## Documentation

Documentation is divided into the following sections.

1. [Installation](docs/01-installation.md)
2. [Listing time entries](docs/02-listing.md)
